                                Functional testing is essential because it verifies that a software application performs its intended functions correctly according to the 
                                specified requirements. By focusing on the functionality of the application from the user's perspective, functional testing ensures that 
                                all features operate as expected, handling inputs and producing outputs accurately. This type of testing helps identify and fix bugs or 
                                defects before the software is deployed, improving the overall quality and reliability of the product. In essence, functional testing 
                                guarantees that the software fulfills its purpose and meets user expectations, which is crucial for maintaining user 
                                satisfaction and trust.
